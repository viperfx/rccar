This project allows a remote control car to be controlled via a ps3 controller. The remote's cover was removed and appropriate pin were connected to an mbed so that the car could be driven by digtal signals output from the mbed. The ps3 controller axis values input are taken and converted to pwm signal values. A good guide is here (http://blog.davidsingleton.org/nnrccar/) for the circuit.
